                <p>In October, 2014, Sister Carol F. McConkie, who was the First Counselor in the Young Women General Presidency, taught that,
                "We live in a world of good and evil, and the physical body can be used for either righteous or wicked purposes. But we
                know that our precious bodies are a gift from God to each of us. They are sacred. Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of
                the Twelve Apostles taught, “To those who know and understand the plan of salvation, defiling the body is an act of
                rebellion [see Mosiah 2:36 - 37] and a denial of our true identity as sons and daughters of God.” We choose to care for
                and protect our bodies so that we may be instruments in the hands of God to bring about His glorious purposes (see Alma
                26:3). If we desire to stand for the Savior and do His work, we must ask ourselves, If the Savior stood beside us, would
                we feel comfortable in the clothing we wear?<br><br>
                
                Modesty in dress, appearance, thought, and behavior is evidence that we understand the covenants we have made that bless
                us, protect us, and empower us in our preparation to return to His presence. When we were baptized, we stepped out of
                the world and into the kingdom of God. Everything must be different for us. Elder Robert D. Hales of the Quorum of the
                Twelve Apostles taught: “By choosing to be in His kingdom, we separate—not isolate—ourselves from the world. Our dress
                will be modest, our thoughts pure, our language clean.”<br><br>
                
                Modesty is a principle that will help keep us safely on the covenant path as we progress to the presence of God. Modesty
                in dress and appearance and in thought and behavior will help prepare us to make and keep sacred temple covenants. To
                bless and protect Adam and Eve, God gave them coats of skins to clothe them before sending them out of the garden. In
                like manner, God has given us a covering of covenants in mortality, symbolized by our sacred temple garments."</p>
